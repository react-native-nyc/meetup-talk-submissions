# React Native NYC Talk Submissions

Interested in speaking at a future React Native NYC meetup? Then you're in the right place.

## Here's what you gotta do:
- Open a [new issue][link-to-github-issue] using our talk submission template and fill out at least all the required fields. You don't need your whole talk planned out at this point, just what you think you'd like to talk about.
- We'll respond to your issue to confirm that we saw it and will let you know if we have any questions. We'll also chat about which date would be best for your talk.
- Anybody who proposes a talk gets priority access to attend the next React Native NYC meetup regardless of whether the talk is accepted (so you don't have to fight for a spot).

## Who can submit talks to React Native NYC?
We welcome & encourage everyone who has something interesting to say about React Native to submit a talk! Whether you literally work at Facebook on the core team, have built multiple apps with React Native or are even a 1st time speaker, we want to hear what you are excited about!

We also welcome talks from folks that live outside of NYC, but can visit / will be visiting NYC on the day of the meetup that they will be scheduled to present at. Please note, that at this time, we're unable to financially support travel to/from NYC for out of town speakers.

## What would be a good talk topic?
A good talk explores a specific facet of working with React Native that you personally have something interesting to say about. It can offer the audience a deep dive into some part of using React Native that they may not have explored in depth before. Or perhaps it tells the audience about how you got your team to use React Native and what the roadmap looks like for your future use of React Native. Or something else entirely? Tell us what you want to talk about!

For example, some previous topics included:
- Bridging Native Modules with Swift
- File Caching in React Native with Hooks
- Prepping for RN 0.60 and AndroidX.
- GraphQL + React Native

## How long is a talk at React Native NYC?
Let's try to keep talks under 20 mins. We won't strike you down if you go over, but 20 mins is a good rule of thumb.

## What do speakers get?
- The chance to tell the group about yourself, your company, and to show everyone how interesting you are!
- We will put you and up to 2 of your friends / colleagues on the attendance list (no fighting for spots)!
- Eternal fame in the halls of React Native NYC!
- If you have an ASK* of the group, we can include it as part of promoting the upcoming meetup where you'll be speaking!

_*For example, if your company is hiring for React Native devs, or if you're looking for a new opportunity, or anything in between (that's appropriate!)_

## When are speakers chosen?
We will try to select speakers two-three weeks before an event. Sometimes there may be last minute drop outs, if which case we may contact you on short notice about subbing in.

## I have more questions about submitting talks, what should I do?
Reach out to [@ilyausorov]( https://github.com/ilyausorov ) or [@bpolonia]( https://github.com/bpolonia ) and we'll be happy to chat! Or just go ahead and make that talk submission issue and we'll chat with you there!
